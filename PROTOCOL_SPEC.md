# MASSO Link UDP Protocol Specification

**⚠️ WORK IN PROGRESS - INCOMPLETE DOCUMENTATION**

**Note**: This protocol specification is based on reverse engineering and packet analysis. Many packet fields and status bytes are not fully understood or documented. This document represents the current state of knowledge and may contain errors or omissions.

---

This document describes the MASSO controller UDP protocol as implemented in `masso_udp_client.py`.

## Overview

- **Transport**: UDP
- **Controller IP**: User-specified (required via --host argument)
- **Send Ports**: 11000-11050 (client binds to one of these)
- **Receive Port**: 65535 (controller broadcasts from this port)
- **Packet Structure**: `[CRC16-CCITT 2 bytes][Magic 0x03 0x00 2 bytes][Type 1 byte][Payload...]`

- **Response**: 38 bytes
  - Tool index at byte 5
  - Tool name starts at byte 6, null-terminated

### File Upload - Data Chunk (Type 0x0B)
- **Request**: Variable length
  - Magic: `0x03 0x00`
  - Type: `0x0B`
  - Chunk Index: 4 bytes (little-endian, starts at 0)

  - Data: 1422 bytes (padded with zeros if needed)
  - Padding: 3 bytes `0x00 0x00 0x00`
- **Response**: 10 bytes

## Controller Identification

The MASSO controller provides identification information through specific packet responses:

### Serial Number Discovery

**Location**: Configuration Response (Type 0x03, 10 bytes)
- **Bytes 5-6**: Serial number stored in little-endian format
- **Range**: 0-65535 (16-bit unsigned integer)
- **Example**: Serial "G3-12345" → numeric part "12345" stored as `0x30 0x39`

**Packet Structure**:
```
Bytes 0-1: Unknown (checksum-related or header)
Bytes 2-3: Packet type confirmation (0x03)
Byte 4:    Unknown field (often 0x03)
Bytes 5-6: Serial number (little-endian)
Bytes 7-9: Reserved (typically 0x00)
```

**Implementation Notes**:
- Serial number is only available in the configuration response
- Must be extracted during initial connection sequence
- Numeric serial range suggests 16-bit unsigned integer format
- The "G3-" prefix (or similar) is not stored in the packet - only numeric portion

**Usage Example**:
```python
# Extract serial from configuration response
serial = int.from_bytes(data[5:7], 'little')  # 12345
print(f"Controller Serial: {serial}")
```

### Version Information

**Location**: Discovery/Version Response (Type 0x02, 46 bytes)
- **Bytes 12+**: Version string (ASCII, null-terminated)
- **Example**: `@Lathe v5.09`

## Status Packet Structure (270 bytes)

Key fields:
- Byte 5: State flags
  - 0x00: Idle
  - 0x40: Ready
  - 0x41: Starting
  - 0x51: Running
  - 0x5a: Running
  - 0x62: Finishing
  - 0x64: Complete
- Byte 6: File state
  - 0x00: Executing
  - 0x02: Loaded
- Bytes 8-11: Job count (little-endian)
- Byte 13: Line number
- Bytes 17-80: Filename (null-terminated, up to 63 bytes)

## Feed Hold Detection

The client detects feed hold when:
1. Machine state is Running (0x51 or 0x5a)
2. File state is Executing (0x00)
3. Line number hasn't changed for 1.5 seconds or more
4. Line number is greater than 0

## Checksum Calculation

CRC16-CCITT algorithm:
- Polynomial: 0x1021
- Initial value: 0x0000
- Input data: Magic + Type + Payload (all bytes after checksum)
- Output: Little-endian 2 bytes

## File Upload Process

1. Send Start Upload packet with filename and file size
2. Wait for ACK (Type 0x0A, 10 bytes)
3. Send file in chunks of 1422 bytes each
4. Each chunk includes chunk index (not byte offset)
5. Wait for ACK after each chunk (Type 0x0B, 10 bytes)
6. Last chunk is padded with zeros to 1422 bytes

## Filename Restrictions

- Maximum length: 15 characters
- ASCII encoding only
- Subdirectories: Use backslash `\` separator
  - Example: `MASSO\file.nc` or `\MASSO\file.nc`
  - Forward slash `/` is not supported
- Directories must exist on MASSO (not created automatically)

## Error Handling

- Upload packets are retried up to 3 times
- Timeout for ACK response: 2.0 seconds
- Filename validation prevents uploads of files with names > 15 characters

## Implementation Notes

- Client binds to first available port in range 11000-11050
- Listen thread runs in background to receive broadcasts
- Keepalive packets sent every 1.0 second when connected
- All packets use little-endian byte order for multi-byte fields

## Unused Protocol Fields

### Unknown 9-Byte Fields (Configuration Request)

**Location**: Configuration Request (Type 0x03) - bytes 5-13

**Finding**: These 9 bytes are **completely ignored** by the MASSO controller.

**Test Results**:
- **Original values** (`0x0d143a1c0b19000000`): Controller responds normally
- **Modified values** (`0x0000000000FFFFFFFF`): Controller responds normally  
- **All zeros** (`0x000000000000000000`): Controller responds normally
- **Random values**: Controller responds normally

**Conclusion**: The controller does not read, validate, or use these 9 bytes for any purpose.

**Implementation Recommendation**:
- Send zeros for maximum simplicity and clarity
- No impact on functionality or reliability
- Reduces code complexity significantly

**Packet Structure**:
```
CLIENT: [checksum][0300][03][000000000][0000]  # Config request (all zeros)
CLIENT: [checksum][0300][01][0000000000]       # Keepalive (5 zeros)
CONTROLLER: [checksum][0300][03][1682][000000] # Response with serial
```

The controller always responds with its own data structure regardless of these field values.

**Note**: The keepalive packet still uses 5 unknown bytes (not 9) as it's a shorter packet structure.

## Undiscovered Packet Types

Unused type values likely represent additional functionality:

**Control Commands (0x04-0x07, 0x09)**:
- Start/stop/pause/resume operations
- Emergency stop functions
- Mode switching

**Machine Control (0x0C-0x1F)**:
- Axis jogging and movement
- Spindle speed control
- Coolant system control
- Parameter configuration

**System Operations (0x20+)**:
- Homing sequences
- Reset operations
- Position queries
- Error status requests

**Investigation Methods**:
- Systematic testing of unused type values with minimal payloads
- Packet capture during operations with official MASSO Link software
- Payload variation analysis to discover parameter mappings
